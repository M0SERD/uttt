\section{Reflexion}
\subsection{Damian Moser}

\subsection{Stefan Jampen}
We started very early with the basic requirements for the project, such as setting up de git repository.
Damian proposed to work with LaTex for our documentation, cause it's perfectly suitable for version control. LaTex is often used in scientific works as well. Because of that, the IDPA, which intends to prepare us for later work at universities, was perfect to try LaTeX for the first time. I'm glad, we made this decision. Once the project was set up, everything worked smooth and we never had problems because all files were always up to date.\\

At the point we made the decision to make an algorithm, I underestimated the complexity to implement the algorithm in code. I wasn't very practised in Object Oriented Programming. I understood the basic concepts, but didn't have any practice experience. Because of that, I wasn't qualified to write code that really contributed to the practical implementation.
I had a little experience in static website scripting, and could finally contribute my knowledge when it came to the implementation of the user interface. In retrospective, I gained a lot of knowledge in dynamic website programming and was able to grasp some concepts, especially in OOP, which I struggled with earlier. 
For a next project, I would make sure, that I would be able to contribute more to the  core of the project.
Despite that I struggled with coding, I could learn a lot from Damians experience, which I really appreciate.\\

I'm very satisfied with the result of our project. We have a perfectly working algorithm, which is extremely hard to beat. Besides that, we also have a good looking website, which makes our project visible to interested people. All in all, I'm proud of us and the final project.
